H1: The Proper Way to Store Your Legal Cannabis in Ontario

Keeping your legal cannabis fresh and potent is a top priority for consumers in Ontario. Without proper cannabis storage, you could find your stash beginning to lose its effectiveness and flavour over time. That's why it's essential to understand how to store cannabis effectively. 

From optimal storage environments to making sure your cannabis stays fresh for as long as possible, we've got you covered. In this guide, you’ll discover tips and tricks on how to store cannabis properly. 

Subheading: Understand the Essential Elements of Cannabis Storage

When it comes to preserving the quality of your cannabis, four main factors come into play: light, air, temperature, and humidity.

1. Light: Studies have shown that UV rays can degrade the quality of cannabis over time. Therefore, it's best to store your cannabis in a dark, cool place. 

2. Air: While your cannabis needs some air to maintain its flavour and smell properly, too much exposure can degrade the batching quality. 

3. Temperature: The ideal storage temperature for cannabis is between 15 to 21 degrees Celsius. Higher temperatures amplify the risk of mould or mildew development. 

4. Humidity: Maintaining proper humidity levels prevents bacteria growth. The ideal relative humidity for cannabis storage is between 59% to 63%.

Subheading: Cannabis Containers – Which is Best?

An essential part of proper cannabis storage is selecting the right container. Many experts recommend using airtight glass jars, commonly known as mason jars. Glass containers are ideal because they adequately control humidity, and are able to keep odours in. Avoid plastics or metal as they can emit substances over time, impacting your cannabis taste.

Subheading: Best Places to Store Your Cannabis 

Since moisture, temperature, light, and air can affect your cannabis, consider storing it in a cool, dark place such as a drawer or a cupboard. A basement works as long as it's dry and doesn't have high humidity.

Subheading: What to Avoid when Storing Cannabis 

Here are a few important things to avoid when storing cannabis:
• Don't store your cannabis in the refrigerator or freezer. The temperature fluctuations can lead to mould and trichome damage.
• Avoid storing cannabis in plastic bags. They can create a static charge that can attract trichomes, leading to a loss of potency.
• Do not store cannabis near appliances that produce heat or spaces subjected to direct sunlight.

Summary:

Knowing how to store cannabis properly can make a significant difference in the overall enjoyment of your product. The ideal cannabis storage environment is cool, dark, and with controlled humidity — away from any direct sunlight, heat, or excessive moisture. If you want to enjoy the freshness and potency of your legal cannabis as long as possible, follow the guide above.
