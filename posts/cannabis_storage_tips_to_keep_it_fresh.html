<h1>Top Cannabis Storage Tips for Preserving Freshness and Potency</h1>

Buying quality cannabis from a trustworthy Ontario-based store is just the first step to a satisfying experience. An often overlooked aspect is storing your cannabis correctly which can significantly prolong its freshness and potency. Whether you're a seasoned connoisseur or new to cannabis, understanding how to store your cannabis is crucial. In this blog article, we will share critical storage tips our knowledgeable team has gathered to enhance your cannabis experience!

<h2>1. The Perfect Storage Conditions</h2>

Cannabis is not unlike fine wine - it needs particular storage conditions to stay fresh and flavourful. A common mistake is either storing cannabis in excessively dry or damp environments that can negatively impact its quality. Ideal conditions are a balance between a cool and slightly humid surrounding. To break it down, the optimised environment is a dark, cool area with a temperature below 25°C and relative humidity between 59% - 63%.

<h2>2. Choosing the Right Container</h2>

Proper storage containers are pivotal in preserving the freshness and potency of your cannabis. An airtight glass jar is your best bet. Why glass? Because it doesn’t seep into the cannabis flavour, as plastic might. Furthermore, glass jars are less likely to allow excess air, light, or moisture in, which safeguards your cannabis from degradation. Remember to keep your stored cannabis in a dark and cool place since direct sunlight can degrade the cannabinoids and terpenes that give cannabis its distinctive aroma and therapeutic effects!

<h2>3. Keep Different Strains Separate</h2>

Every cannabis strain possesses a unique aroma and flavour profile. To maintain the unique properties of each strain, it’s essential to store them separately. Mixing strains can not only mix the aromas and flavours but also degrade the potency. When segregating the strains, ensure you label the containers clearly, so you always know what you’re consuming.

<h2>4. Avoid the Fridge and Freezer</h2>

While cool, dark places are excellent for cannabis storage, refrigerators and freezers aren't ideal. Cold temperatures can cause trichomes, the tiny, resinous glands on cannabis buds containing the majority of cannabinoids, to become brittle and break off. Furthermore, frequent in-and-out movements can cause humidity fluctuations that promote mold growth, making it unsafe for consumption.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

While it might seem tricky at first, storing cannabis correctly is an indispensable skill for any enthusiast. Remember, the key is to control the environmental factors – light, air, moisture and temperature. Understanding these storage concepts can go a long way in preserving your cannabis's freshness and potency, amplifying your experience every time!
