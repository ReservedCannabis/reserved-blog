<h1>Cannabis Storage Tips to Keep Your Herb Fresh</h1>

When you find a strain of cannabis that you truly enjoy, you want to savour it for as long as possible. All too often, consumers find that their cannabis gets stale, loses flavour, or becomes harder to consume due to improper storage. Here at your favourite Ontario cannabis store, we pride ourselves not just on offering a varied selection of top-shelf products but also on helping our customers make the most of their cannabis purchases. This includes educating you on storing your cannabis properly to ensure maximum freshness.

<h2>Why Is Proper Cannabis Storage So Important?</h2>

Well-stored cannabis will maintain its aroma, flavour, and potency for an extended period. Conversely, poor storage can lead to the growth of mould, degradation of cannabinoids, loss of terpenes, and a harsh, stale taste when consumed. Our education-focused approach is designed to help customers understand factors like these that can significantly impact their cannabis experience.

<h2>Optimal Conditions for Storing Cannabis</h2>

Firstly, let's talk about where not to store your cannabis. Stay clear of areas with intense light, humidity fluctuations or high temperatures like your window ledge or kitchen. Cannabis storage is more akin to wine storage than anything else. Ideal conditions are dark, cool and with a relative humidity (RH) level between 59% - 63%.

To start, look for storage containers that protect your cannabis from light exposure and temperature fluctuations. Airtight, opaque containers are your best friend. The idea is to keep just enough fresh air in your storage container without the stash drying out. Your everyday Mason jar stored in a cool dark place will do the trick quite nicely.

Two more allies in your cannabis storage journey are humidity packs and vacuum sealer. Humidity packs maintain the optimum RH level for your cannabis automatically and help inhibit mould growth. Vacuum sealers take all the remaining oxygen out of the bag, stopping the oxidation process that can degrade your cannabis.

Lastly, do not store your cannabis in the refrigerator or freezer. The fluctuations in temperature and humidity can actually pull moisture out of the cannabis plant, leading to dry stale flowers that are harsh on the throat and low in efficacy.

<h2>Proper Cannabis Hygiene Matters</h2>

Remember, every time you dive into your stash, you expose your cannabis to air, touching it with your hands and potentially introducing microbes. To avoid contamination, use clean tools and hands when handling your cannabis. Keeping smaller amounts out for immediate use will minimize exposure to the rest of your cannabis.
